This is my shot at recreating Andy Sloane's legendary rotating donut. It took me a few hours, the matrix calculations were painful, but I had a lot of fun. It works pretty well in the end, although it's a lot less concise than the original code. I tried to make every step relatively clear and understandble, and I may eventually add other shapes, enable user input or try to optimise the program.
